1 Description
------------- 
The “tidy.txt” dataset is a summarized dataset that is created as part of a class project for the Data Cleaning course held on Coursera.org. The data was processed using R. 

The source data that will be used is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset that comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It represents data built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, measurements of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  

A limited set of measurements were retained from the original data and a mean was calculated for each subject/activity combination in the data.  The file is tab delimited and all columns except for activity is numeric.
